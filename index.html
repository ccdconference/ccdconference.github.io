 	 <p class="title" id="event">The Conference</p>
	 <p><span class="CCD">Composer/Computer/Distance</span> is a two day conference in the heart of Sheffield. Our aim is to provide an activity that celebrates diversity in the computer music field. We will be celebrating and examining the work of artists that self-identify with marginalized bodies. Guest artists will present, perform, and interact with local and regional emerging artists and the general public. We've charged our presenters to make their talks accessible to the general public in order to continue building a diverse audience for computer music. We welcome pre-university students, emerging artists, academics, and professionals alike to the event and look forward to bringing Diana Salazar, Joanne Armitage, Rebecca Fiebrink, and Judit Tövissy to Sheffield!</p>

 	 		<p class="bio"><span class="name">Dr Joanne Armitage</span> is a creative technologist and artist working with sound, physical computing, digital media and interaction design. She is a Teaching Fellow in Digital Media at the University of Leeds and her current practice-based research explores how digital sound can connect with the body through haptic feedback. Other than her research, Joanne is also notable for her practice in live coded music, which she performs internationally using the SuperCollider language. She is one half of the live coding duo ALGOBABEZ with Shelly Knotts, associated with the Algorave movement. She holds a PhD from the University of Leeds with a focus on the development of bespoke vibrating interfaces for ‘feeling’ sound to explore the audio-tactile relationship. She won The Daphne Oram Award Lecture for Digital Innovation and was invited to give a lecture titled ‘Can you feel the music?’ at the British Science Festival. The lecture investigated how haptic devices can intensify our musical experiences. By considering the ways in which the body interacts with and mediates sound, she talked about how she has developed special vibrating installations and performance systems that allow participants to enter unique listening environments. Joanne is a well-known advocate for diversity in music and technology, including through invited workshops and talks.</p>

 	 		<p class="bio"><span class="name">Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink</span> is a Senior Lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London.  Her research focuses on designing new ways for humans to interact with computers in creative practice. As both a computer scientist and a musician, much of her work focuses on applications of machine learning to music: for example, how can machine learning algorithms help people to create new musical instruments and interactions? How does machine learning change the type of musical systems that can be created, the creative relationships between people and technology, and the set of people who can create new technologies? Much of Fiebrink’s work is also driven by a belief in the importance of inclusion, participation, and accessibility. She works frequently with human-centred and participatory design processes, and she is currently working on projects related to creating new accessible technologies with people with disabilities, designing inclusive machine learning curricula and tools, and applying participatory design methodologies in the digital humanities.

			Fiebrink is the developer of the Wekinator, open-source software for real-time interactive machine learning whose current version has been downloaded over 10,000 times. She is the creator of a MOOC titled “Machine Learning for Artists and Musicians,” which launched in 2016 on the Kadenze platform.  She was previously an Assistant Professor at Princeton University, where she co-directed the Princeton Laptop Orchestra. She has worked with companies including Microsoft Research, Sun Microsystems Research Labs, Imagine Research, and Smule, where she helped to build the #1 iTunes app "I am T-Pain." She has performed with a variety of musical ensembles, including as a laptopist in Sideband and Squirrel in the Mirror, the principal flutist in the Timmins Symphony Orchestra, and the keyboardist in the University of Washington computer science rock band "The Parody Bits.” She holds a PhD in Computer Science from Princeton University. </p>

			<span class="name">Judit Tövissy</span> is a computer scientist working as a software engineer with the organization Ericsson. She is an expert coder in Python, C#, Java, and MaxScript. Her research has included automated stereoscopic image conversion and reconstruction as well as artificial intelligence. She has published on the subject matter through the Eastern Academic Journal and continues to investigate various phenomenon with the effectiveness of artificial intelligence behaviors in complex tactical game scenarios. Judit was selected for our activity to help musicians, artists, and the general public understand the scientific limitations of artificial intelligence as well as its potentialities in the arts from an outside perspective.Judit has her own blog, Instinct 4 Code, where she writes to explain programming concepts in an endeavour to make coding more available to people with little or no technical background.</p>

 	 		<p class="bio" class="paragraph"><span class="name">Diana Salazar</span> is a Scottish composer and sound artist. Her works include acousmatic compositions, music for instruments with live electronics, installations and cross-disciplinary collaborations. Diana’s compositions and performances are characterized by the exploration of sonic spaces, from the exploration of dynamic gesture chains and sound trajectories through to vivid fields of texture, woven to evoke rich sonic landscapes. 
 	 		Following undergraduate and Masters studies at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow she continued to study for a Ph.D. at the University of Manchester (UK), funded by a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council Scholarship. Since completing her doctorate in 2010, she has lectured at Kingston University, City University London and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where she is currently Acting Head of the BMus Programme. 
 	 		Diana’s works have been performed throughout the UK and internationally, with broadcasts on Swedish National Radio, Radio France, BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio Scotland.  Her works have been recognized in international competitions including CIMESP (International Electroacoustic Contest of São Paulo), the Bourges Competition of Electroacoustic Music, SCRIME, L’Espace du Son Diffusion Competition, Prix Destellos, Música Viva, the Non-Classical Remix Competition and the International Computer Music Conference Regional Awards. Selected works have been released on the Studio PANaroma, Discparc, SCRIME, Drift Station, Elektramusic, Abeille Music and CMMAS labels.
 	 		As an electronic improviser she has performed solo and in collaborations with John Robert Ferguson (as ‘Porous Torsion’), Manuella Blackburn (as ‘The Splice Girls’), Kingston University Digital Arts Ensemble, Kairos, and with dancer Maria Salgado Llopis.</p>
